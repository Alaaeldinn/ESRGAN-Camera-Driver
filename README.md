# ESRGAN-CAMERA-DRIVER 
PyTorch implementation of a Real-ESRGAN model trained on custom dataset. The ESRGAN Camera Driver is a versatile solution that empowers your camera device, be it a webcam or any other camera, to provide real-time image enhancement. Leveraging the power of ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network), this project elevates your visual experience by producing super-resolved, high-quality images and videos on the fly.

Real-ESRGAN is an upgraded [ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219) trained with pure synthetic data is capable of enhancing details while removing annoying artifacts for common real-world images.
